## LED Matrix

The Calliope mini's LED matrix features 5 x 5 = 25 red LEDs, capable of displaying not only numbers and texts but also images and even animations. The brightness of individual pixels can be adjusted. 

### Light Measurement

----

## Buttons

The Calliope mini has 3 buttons.
**Button A and B** are programmable buttons. They can be used to control program flows. The **Reset button** is not programmable. It is permanently implemented in the firmware and is used to restart the program on the Calliope mini.

## Position Sensor

- LSM303AGR
- Connected via I2C
- 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis magnetometer, 2-axis gyroscope
- Link to datasheet 

----

## RGB LEDs

WS2812C-2020

The Calliope mini has three integrated RGB LEDs, capable of representing 255 colors per color channel (red, green, blue). This corresponds to 256^3 = 16,777,216 colors.
The RGB LEDs are addressable pixels, known as Neopixels. These are special individually programmable RGB LEDs, similar to individual pixels on a display.

## Speaker

MLT-8530

----

## Microphone

SPU0410HR5H-PB

The MEMS microphone can measure sound pressure level (SPL) and volume.

## Motor Driver

<Versions>
    <div slot="mini1-2">
        DRV8837

        The motor driver for Calliope mini Versions 1 and 2 is the DRV8837. The motor driver consists of an H-bridge circuit. It can drive one motor 
        Up to two motors can be connected. If one motor is connected, all motor modes can be used. If two motors are connected, they must share the H-bridge, and the motors can only move forward or backward simultaneously, not in opposite directions. 
     
        **Single Motor Logic:**

        | IN1 | IN2 | OUT1 | OUT2  | Mode     |
        |-----|-----|------|-------|-----------|
        | 0   | 0   | Z    | Z     | Idle      |
        | 0   | 1   | L    | H     | Reverse   |
        | 1   | 0   | H    | L     | Forward   |
        | 1   | 1   | L    | L     | Brake     |

        DRV8835

This motor driver has 2 separate H-bridge drivers and can thus independently control 2 DC motors. The maximum input voltage is 9V, and the maximum current per motor is 1.5A.
Here is a link to the [datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/drv8835.pdf?ts=1697459375123)
**Brief Information:**
- Controls 2 motors, each motor can move forward and backward
- Motors can be connected to the terminal block
- Maximum input voltage 9V; maximum current 1.5A per motor
- Operates in Phase/Enable mode (Mode=1) in which the firmware controls the motor direction through a digital signal and the speed through a [PWM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation) signal
